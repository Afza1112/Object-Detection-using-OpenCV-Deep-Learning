# üß† Object Detection using OpenCV and Deep Learning

This project demonstrates **real-time object detection** using **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **pre-trained deep learning models** such as YOLO or MobileNet-SSD.  
It detects and highlights objects in images or videos with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time object detection from images, videos, or webcam  
- Uses pre-trained models (YOLO / MobileNet-SSD) for accurate detection  
- Displays bounding boxes and confidence levels for each detected object  
- Simple and well-documented Jupyter Notebook implementation  
- Easily customizable for new datasets or model types  

## üß© Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**  
- **OpenCV** (for image processing and DNN module)  
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for demonstration and visualization)  
- **Pre-trained Models** (Caffe, TensorFlow, or YOLO weights)


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
